                    In response to the COVID-19 crisis, laboratories around the world have ceased in-person human data
                    collection. In principle, many of these laboratories could run their studies online. With over
                    4,000,000,000 people online, most populations of interest are reachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workshop serves to help laboratories get their research online, covering the key
                    technologies necessary as well as best practices when designing for research on the Web. We will

                    trials, and a concluding debriefing page. This includes understanding the nature of jsPsych's
                    plugin-based framework, options for creating and adding trials, and where to go for more

                <p>
                    Following up on Session 1, we will dive deeper into harnessing the features of jsPsych to be able to
                    create more complicated study design features necessary for most research studies; this includes
                    dynamically-generated stimuli, performance-based branching, and complex condition randomization and
                    sampling. Core topics will include:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions as parameters (e.g. practice trials show correct/incorrect stimulus based on previous
                        response)</li>
                    <li>Timeline variables: randomizing and sampling (e.g. repeating the same type of trial with
                        differentsets of stimuli)</li>
                    <li>Conditional and looping behavior (e.g. practice trials repeat if accuracy is below threshold)
                    </li>
                    <li>Working with jsPsych data (e.g. showing a performance summary at the end of the task)</li>
                    <li>A tour of plugin code and how to create plugins</li>
                </ul>

                    Pushkin provides a customizable, scalable ecosystem for massive online psychological experiments. In
                    this session, we will cover how to set up your online Pushkin-based laboratory and the included
                    features, including:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing participation incentives, such as results shareable on social media or game-like
                        features such as earning badges for participation (for users who create an account on the
                        website)</li>
                    <li>Scaling to balance spikes in website traffic</li>
                    <li>Storing results in a database</li>

                    <li>Supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop devices</li>
                    <li>Enabling user accounts for longitudinal studies and boosting participant return rates (e.g. for
                        collecting data for a single participant on multiple studies, with the potential to
                        cross-analyze results within subjects)</li>
                    <li>Supporting a forum, where participants may discuss questions and provide feedback on various
                        aspects of the experiments</li>
                </ul>
                The general structure of this session will cover:<br />

                        Dr. Jennifer Roddâ€™s research focuses on how people are able to understand language. What are the
                        cognitive and brain processes that are necessary to understand another personâ€™s speech? For
                        instance, understanding a sentence is more than simply understanding the constituent words â€”
                        these need to be integrated into a larger conceptual framework and this very often involves
                        resolving ambiguity in the meaning of words. People use a number of different strategies to do
                        this and Jenniâ€™s work aims to identify these, to understand how they work mechanistically, and
                        to explore their underpinnings in the brain.
